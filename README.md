# CMD-COMPILIER

## Description

- The basic concept behind this project was to orchestrate and demonstarte my abilities to show how I can use the CLI to make a whole README and/or any form to that is needed in the future. Basically, I am able to program the CLI to take input form a USER and then display it to any form of text, whether it be HTML, TEXT, JS, or MD. 

- This project was to display my abilites in the knowledge of FileSystem, JavaSvript, Packages downloaded from NPM and the ability to code it directly to respond to what I needed it to respond to.

- This project is the resolution to many advocates trying to write a 'simple' README.me that seems to be troublesome...basically, my program is an array of quetions that you should include into your 'README' to have it portray more professional vs it just being a ....here's x and here's y. 

- The learning aspect from this project for ME persoanlly is the ability to utilize CLI and also to get a better understanding of GitHub and how it works...since I'm the only one adding and commiting and pushing to the main branch. 

- Normally I would have a table of contents, except, this is my first 'official' attempt at this so...don't be alarmed if you don't see one.

## Usage

- Basically covered this above with my long essay, bottom line is...this is a template compilier that ANYONE can use to avhieve the goal of installing 'inquirer' and getting the basic knowledge of it from coding just JS.

## Credits

- As far as 'credits' go, I would like to acknowledge my istructor "Byran Swarthout" and my TA "Shawn Tscheope" for their outstanding knowledge in this
